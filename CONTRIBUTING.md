# Contributing to UWP Conceptual Documentation

Thank you for your interest in the Microsoft Partner documentation! We appreciate your feedback, edits, and additions to our docs.

## Writing content

Our documentation is written in Markdown, a lightweight text style syntax. If you're not familiar with Markdown, you can [learn the basics on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). When unsure, you can always copy the formatting style from other pages in our docs.

## Public contributions

If you are **not** a Microsoft employee, you can contribute through the [public content repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/partner-rest). Public contributions are appropriate for changes and clarifications to existing pages.

### Editing a file

If you're already in the public content repository, start by navigating to the file you want to change. From there, select the pencil icon above the displayed content to begin editing.

Alternately, if you're viewing a page in docs.microsoft.com, you can select the **Edit** button on the upper-right portion of the page. This will redirect you to the associated source file in the repository.

When you begin editing, GitHub automatically forks the official repo into your personal GitHub account, where you can make your changes. When you're done, submit a pull request back to the **docs** branch.

### Pull requests

After you submit your pull request, it is evaluated against a content quality checklist to ensure it meets our basic standards. If it passes, it is assigned to a member of the documentation team for further review. If it fails, you'll be told what changes to make.

The assigned reviewer(s) may approve or reject the PR, or work with you to make further changes.

### Making substantial changes

To make more extensive changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, create a local clone of the GitHub repo.

## Using issues to provide feedback on documentation

If you want to provide feedback on the docs instead of making edits yourself, you can [create an issue in the public repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/partner-rest/issues). Select the **Issues** tab and select the **New issue** button. Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page. Your issue will be assigned to members of the UWP documentation team for review.
